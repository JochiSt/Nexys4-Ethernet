# Ethernet on the NEXYS-4 Board

Trying to get an Ethernet connection with the Nexys-4 Board. Evaluating the usage of an Open Source FPGA programming toolchain.

Toolchain used:
1. GHDL
1. YOSYS
1. nextpnr-xilinx
1. openFPGAloader

Since the above toolchain did not work at first glance, I tried a different approach using Vivado and HDLmake.
